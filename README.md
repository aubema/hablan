In collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the STRATOS project, we will launch a dual DSLR system to observe the multiangular and spectral properties of the installed luminaires from an altitude of 36 km. STRATOS project consists of high altitude balloon flights to perform a variety of near space experiments. Two Sony A7S cameras will be attached to a gimbal in order to assure a nadir pointing stability. The balloon will take off at Timmins (ON, Canada), and will land near Val dâ€™Or (QC, Canada), going over Rouyn-Noranda (QC, Canada). The experiment will take place around the new moon of August 2019. One of the two cameras is equipped with a 50mm lens, assuring the collection of high-resolution images (6 m per pixel). Data, such as multispectral radiance of light points and spectral type recognition, ground cover, and obstacles properties will be derived from this camera. The other camera is equipped with an 8mm fisheye lens so that the angular function of the luminaires will be sampled up to almost 90-degrees from zenith. Close to the flight, ground-based data will be acquired. For instance, we will use the LANcube multiangular and multispectral sensor in a roadrunner mode to map the light at night all over the overflown region. We will also sample the sky brightness with a third A7S camera equipped with a fisheye lens.
